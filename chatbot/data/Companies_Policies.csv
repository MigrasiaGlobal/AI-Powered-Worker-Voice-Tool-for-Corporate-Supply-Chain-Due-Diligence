23Andme,"INTRODUCTION OUR PRACTICES OUR PEOPLE OUR PRODUCTS OUR PLANET APPENDIX
Though we are in the initial stages of our ESG journey, 23andMe
recognizes the importance of swiftly mitigating climate change. We are
mindful of our environmental impact and seek to make our business
practices more sustainable.
Environmental Management
Since we lease all our buildings, we face certain limitations in reducing our operational 
footprint. Nevertheless, we plan to develop more robust systems to track our energy, water, 
and waste data across our portfolio of properties. In addition, one of our main offices in 
Sunnyvale, California, is LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified 
with a Platinum rating. 
The COVID-19 pandemic challenged us to rethink how we operate, and many of our 
employees transitioned to working from home or in a hybrid model. This move has reduced 
our facilities’ energy and water usage and lessened emissions from commuting. We offer 
public transit subsidies for employees who need to come into an office.
As we re-evaluate our real estate portfolio in upcoming years, we plan to incorporate building 
certifications and other environmental considerations into our leasing decisions.  
 
zzzz Our office in Sunnyvale, CA was designed with sustainability in mind.

Ab Inbev," based on a 
methodology that seeks to identify and measure 
climate-related risks and opportunities using a 
four-step process: 
1. Set time horizon: 
To evaluate risks and opportunities, we set a time 
horizon as follows: 
a.  Short term: 1-5 years (included in our existing risk 
management processes);
b. Medium term: 5-10 years; 
c. Long term: 10+ years.
2. Identify, rate and rank driving forces: 
In line with the recommendations of the TCFD 
framework, we evaluated risks associated with: 
a.  Policy: the environmental policies and regulatory 
considerations where our organization operates 
and the implications on our direct and indirect 
supply chain; 
b.  Technology: risks and opportunities associated 
with product development, manufacturing and 
production; 
c.  Market changes: societal changes related 
to consumer preferences and shifts in 
demographics and lifestyle choices; 
d.  Reputation: changing consumer or community 
preferences related to how the company 
responds to climate impact; 
e.  Ecological: risks associated with both chronic 
and acute physical risks, including extreme 
weather events and/ or water scarcity in both 
our operations and supply chain.
To help guide the risks and opportunities included 
for analysis in the 2022 update, we engaged with 
leaders across functions and geographic regions 
of the business to prioritize a list of topics that 
could have the most significant impact to the 
business. The selected topics and associated 
analysis can be found in the tables on the 
following page.
3. Develop relevant scenarios: 
The risks and opportunities described here were 
considered under two scenarios for physical 
risks and two scenarios for transition risks, taking 
into account the implications over the long and 
medium term. Short-term risks are not considered 
here, as the analysis of these risks are included 
in our internal risk management processes. For 
more information on the short-terms risks to 
our business related to climate, please see the 
management report of our 2022 Annual Report.
For the analysis of physical risks and opportunities, 
we considered two scenarios,",AB_20InBev_2022_20ESG_20Report_FINAL.pdf page no.:96,"with the principles of this Policy, while contin uing to respect the laws and regulations of 
the host country. Should there be differences between the content of this Policy and 
national laws or other applicable standards, the more stringent standard shall apply 6. In 
circumstances when there is a question as to whether this Policy can be followed, or there 
is a conflict between applicable law and these standards, colleagues must seek guidance 
from the local Ethics & Compliance team before taking action. 
 
4. Implementation and Training 
The Global and Zone Corporate Affairs teams will take steps to ensure the Policy 
is communicated effectively and an appropriate training program is put in place. 
 
All AB InBev employees are owners of this Policy and are responsible for being 
familiar with its content. Manager s and supervisors of one or more employee(s) will be 
expected to be familiar with the contents of this Policy, regardless of whether they have 
undergone formal training on its contents. 
 
5. Assessment and Policy Updates 
AB InBev will assess the compliance of its operating units with its human rights 
commitments by implementing periodic risk-based human rights assessments, including 
legal reviews, impact assessments, self -assessment questionnaires and auditing 
protocols as appropriate. We engage w ith external stakeholders on issues that impact 
human rights and report on our efforts to support human rights in the context of the UN 
Global Compact principles annually. To ensure its continued relevance and 
effectiveness, this Policy will be periodically reviewed and, when necessary, modified. 
 
6. Human Rights Principles 
The following human rights principles are those that AB InBev considers to be the 
most salient. 
 
However, it is not the intent of this Policy to undermine a bona fide negotiation 
process with constituent workers groups. Therefore, as indicated in footnote 6, Zones 
can apply to the Global Ethics & Compliance Committee for specific accommodations or 
exceptions to this Policy. Such application will be reviewed on a case by case basis by 
the Committee. 
 
A. Child Labor and Young People 
AB InBev prohibits the employment and exploitation of children within its facilities 
and will not engage in or support the use of child labor as defined by the ILO",InBev_-_Global_Human_Rights_Policy_2019_.pdf page no.:3," wage, work 
hours, overtime and benefits laws and regulations and local labor agreements.  If the 
employment contract allows for overtime, it must be on a voluntary basis and workers 
must expressly agree to it. 
3.14 Business Partners should strive to provide workers with a pay and benefits package 
that supports an adequate standard of living.  Wages and benefits shall be equal or 
superior to the applicable minimum legal and regulatory requirements, and 
compensation terms established by legally  binding collective bargaining agreements 
must be  implemented and adhered to. Business  Partners must communicate 
employment terms and conditions before onboarding of workers. Workers must 
receive payment for work regularly, in full and on time, and should have access to a 
pay slip, explaining their wage and any deductions.  Other than legally mandated 
deductions, all other deductions from wages must be made only with the express and 
written consent of the workers, and in compliance with applicable laws and 
international human rights standards.    
3.15 Business Partners are encouraged to provide workers with opportunities to develop 
their skills and capabilities and, where possible, provide opportunities for 
advancement.  
4. Workplace Safety and Health 
4.1 Business Partners must ensure high standards of occupational health and safety 
throughout their organizations and strive to prevent all accidents, injuries and 
occupational illnesses within their operations through management leadership and 
employee involvement.  
4.2 Health and safety practices must, at minimum, comply with applicable laws. If such 
laws do not meet minimum standards under international best practice, the higher",InBev_Responsible_Sourcing_Policy_2020.pdf page no.:4

Employee Health Programs
In 2022, ADM launched a pilot program with Medcor/Work Right at 
its site in Decatur, Illinois, that can not only assess and treat minor 
injuries onsite, but also provide injury prevention resources to 
colleagues. The program includes ergonomic assessments and 
recommendations for our colleagues’ workspaces, suggested 
stretching and rehabilitation exercises to prevent injuries related to 
repetitive movements or poor posture, and even massages. 
Employees can make appointments with the Medcor/Work Right 
team for advice and treatment at no cost.
We provide access to several virtual health support programs for 
our colleagues. For example, access to Hinge Health can help 
employees suffering from muscle or joint pain to work with a virtual 
care team to assess and develop a personalized exercise plan, 
reduce pain, find physical therapists, and more. We also provide 
weight management support through Wondr Health, diabetes and 
blood pressure management through Livongo, and a smoking 
cessation program in partnership with the American Cancer Society 
Quit for Life® program.

Climate Scenario Modeling 
AIG takes a common approach to climate risk 
management across our organization, including 
identifying and monitoring climate risks through   
top-down, bottom-up approaches, risk profiling   
and/or exposure analysis to climate-relevant sectors. 
In the UK, Australia, Singapore and Japan, AIG 
has completed climate stress tests as prescribed 
by the local regulatory authority or (in the case 
of Japan) on a voluntary basis. These exercises 
considered the physical, transition and liability 
risks for various climate-related scenarios. Physical 
scenarios align with the IPCC Representative 
Concentration Pathways. Transition scenarios align 
with the Network for Greening the Financial System 
in the transition to net zero. Refer to Table 5 for a 
summary of scenarios completed. 
AIG is in the process of developing a global climate 
scenario incorporating the risk exposure of our 
global entities. The global climate scenario will help 
us consider the transition, physical and liability 
risks for three climate-related stress scenarios, 
including an orderly transition, disorderly transition 
and hot house world scenario. AIG intends to 
develop management actions in response to the 
stress test results, as appropriate.

Though we are in the initial stages of our ESG journey, 23andMe
recognizes the importance of swiftly mitigating climate change. We are
mindful of our environmental impact and seek to make our business
practices more sustainable.
Environmental Management
Since we lease all our buildings, we face certain limitations in reducing our operational 
footprint. Nevertheless, we plan to develop more robust systems to track our energy, water, 
and waste data across our portfolio of properties. In addition, one of our main offices in 
Sunnyvale, California, is LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified 
with a Platinum rating. 
The COVID-19 pandemic challenged us to rethink how we operate, and many of our 
employees transitioned to working from home or in a hybrid model. This move has reduced 
our facilities’ energy and water usage and lessened emissions from commuting. We offer 
public transit subsidies for employees who need to come into an office.
As we re-evaluate our real estate portfolio in upcoming years, we plan to incorporate building 
certifications and other environmental considerations into our leasing decisions.

Ab Inbev," based on a 
methodology that seeks to identify and measure 
climate-related risks and opportunities using a 
four-step process: 
1. Set time horizon: 
To evaluate risks and opportunities, we set a time 
horizon as follows: 
a.  Short term: 1-5 years (included in our existing risk 
management processes);
b. Medium term: 5-10 years; 
c. Long term: 10+ years.
2. Identify, rate and rank driving forces: 
In line with the recommendations of the TCFD 
framework, we evaluated risks associated with: 
a.  Policy: the environmental policies and regulatory 
considerations where our organization operates 
and the implications on our direct and indirect 
supply chain; 
b.  Technology: risks and opportunities associated 
with product development, manufacturing and 
production; 
c.  Market changes: societal changes related 
to consumer preferences and shifts in 
demographics and lifestyle choices; 
d.  Reputation: changing consumer or community 
preferences related to how the company 
responds to climate impact; 
e.  Ecological: risks associated with both chronic 
and acute physical risks, including extreme 
weather events and/ or water scarcity in both 
our operations and supply chain.
To help guide the risks and opportunities included 
for analysis in the 2022 update, we engaged with 
leaders across functions and geographic regions 
of the business to prioritize a list of topics that 
could have the most significant impact to the 
business. The selected topics and associated 
analysis can be found in the tables on the 
following page.
3. Develop relevant scenarios: 
The risks and opportunities described here were 
considered under two scenarios for physical 
risks and two scenarios for transition risks, taking 
into account the implications over the long and 
medium term. Short-term risks are not considered 
here, as the analysis of these risks are included 
in our internal risk management processes. For 
more information on the short-terms risks to 
our business related to climate, please see the 
management report of our 2022 Annual Report.

Employee Health Programs
In 2022, ADM launched a pilot program with Medcor/Work Right at 
its site in Decatur, Illinois, that can not only assess and treat minor 
injuries onsite, but also provide injury prevention resources to 
colleagues. The program includes ergonomic assessments and 
recommendations for our colleagues’ workspaces, suggested 
stretching and rehabilitation exercises to prevent injuries related to 
repetitive movements or poor posture, and even massages. 
Employees can make appointments with the Medcor/Work Right 
team for advice and treatment at no cost.
We provide access to several virtual health support programs for 
our colleagues. For example, access to Hinge Health can help 
employees suffering from muscle or joint pain to work with a virtual 
care team to assess and develop a personalized exercise plan, 
reduce pain, find physical therapists, and more. We also provide 
weight management support through Wondr Health, diabetes and 
blood pressure management through Livongo, and a smoking 
cessation program in partnership with the American Cancer Society

Climate Scenario Modeling 
AIG takes a common approach to climate risk 
management across our organization, including 
identifying and monitoring climate risks through   
top-down, bottom-up approaches, risk profiling   
and/or exposure analysis to climate-relevant sectors. 
In the UK, Australia, Singapore and Japan, AIG 
has completed climate stress tests as prescribed 
by the local regulatory authority or (in the case 
of Japan) on a voluntary basis. These exercises 
considered the physical, transition and liability 
risks for various climate-related scenarios. Physical 
scenarios align with the IPCC Representative 
Concentration Pathways. Transition scenarios align 
with the Network for Greening the Financial System 
in the transition to net zero. Refer to Table 5 for a 
summary of scenarios completed. 
AIG is in the process of developing a global climate 
scenario incorporating the risk exposure of our 
global entities. The global climate scenario will help 
us consider the transition, physical and liability 
risks for three climate-related stress scenarios, 
including an orderly transition, disorderly transition 
and hot house world scenario. AIG intends to 
develop management actions in response to the 
stress test results, as appropriate.

The LGBTQIA+ Health Benefits Guideline is a compilation of the health 
benefits Akamai provides to U.S. employees to support their journey to and 
through gender affirming care and LGBTQIA+ community physical and

easily find links to related insurance policies and resources. This will help 
them to understand quickly what services are covered, what is required and 
how to access these benefits.
This guideline is the result of the collaborative work between Akamai’s 
internal Global Benefits team and Akamai’s internal ID&E office, and 
it demonstrates the efforts made to maintain very high standards to 
promote equity and inclusion in the workplace. This effort began in 2022

The Akamai Career Hub (ACH) tries to provide individuals with visibility

The ACH also suggests activities that will accelerate development as an 
individual advances in their career with Akamai. This new technology 
reinforces our philosophy that career paths and advancement look different 
for all employees. The platform takes into account an employee’s full skill 
set, acknowledging that competencies and experiences are important in 
suggesting potential next steps. Similarly, ACH will suggest jobs with skills 
that are similar to those included in an employee’s ACH profile. ACH jobs 
alerts are not suggested based on an individual’s current organizational 
level, hierarchy, reporting, title, etc. and may include roles that are below,

analysis. Hazards should be eliminated or con-
trolled through proper design, engineering, proce-
dural controls, and ongoing safety training. Where 
hazards cannot be adequately controlled by these 
means, the workforce will be provided with appro-
priate, well-maintained personal protective equip-

injuries, Southern Company suppliers are encour-
aged to report near misses. They are empowered 
and expected to stop the job if they observe 
work being performed in an unsafe manner by 
either a Southern Company employee or Southern 
Company supplier conducting Southern Company-

dling competitive data, proprietary information and 
other intellectual property. Suppliers will comply with 
legal requirements regarding fair competition and

against a person for reporting a compliance or ethical 
issue or for any other reason. Southern Company’s 
goal is to have a work environment where employ-
ees and suppliers feel safe to report issues without 
fear of retaliation or retribution. Southern Company 
expects its suppliers to protect an individual’s right  
to report misconduct or noncompliance with regula-
tions or other ethical issues. Suppliers must comply 
with Whistleblower laws, including those promul-

Albertsons Companies 
Vendor Code of Conduct  
To promote our values and ethical standards throughout our supply chain, Albertsons 
Companies has adopted a Vendor Code of Conduct13 (COC) that sets minimum 
expectations for suppliers (Vendors) who conduct business with Albertsons Companies. 
The COC is a general guide to standards of business practice and regulatory compliance 
that applies to Vendors of Albertsons Companies Inc. or its (direct and indirect) 
subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Albertsons Companies Companies”).  
  
For example, as stated in the COC (Section IV, articles A-F), all Albertsons 
Companies Vendors will:   
• “…conduct their employment practices in full compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations in all of their global operations”  
• “Use only voluntary labor. The use of forced labor whether in the form of 
indentured labor, bonded labor, or prison labor by a Safeway Companies  
Vendor or its subcontractors is unacceptable”  
• “Comply with all minimum age laws and requirements and not employ child 
labor”",Supplier-Sustainability-Expectations-1-7-2022.pdf page no.:50

STRATEGY 
We are aware of the business risks from climate change, and we 
continuously monitor environment-related risks and opportunities that 
may impact our business over the short-, medium- and long-term. The 
nature of these risks depends on both the physical aspects of climate 
change as well as market regulations, pressure to reduce our carbon 
footprint and our ability to understand and respond to rapidly evolving 
developments. Our identified risks include the following:
REGULATORY RISKS – We could be impacted by regulatory risks such 
as potential future carbon disclosure and compliance requirements. 
Possible carbon tax, or regulatory incentives to encourage the use of 
renewable energy could affect energy costs. Regulatory action can also 
include pressure to reduce the carbon footprint of specific medical 
devices as well as a greater focus on environmental considerations in 
manufacturing and responsible procurement. 
PHYSICAL RISK – The physical aspects of climate change can have an 
impact on our ability to continue operations. We regularly assess how 
potential business disruptions from extreme weather and natural 
disasters could impact our business. These risks and responses are 
reviewed as part of the overall sustainability risk evaluation.
 
RISK RELATED TO RESOURCE USE – There is increasing scrutiny on 
the use of water in manufacturing and the amount of plastic waste. 
Pressure from regulators, consumers and other stakeholders to find 
alternatives or green solutions to reduce our use of natural resources 
is escalating. In 2021, we embedded our Environmental Sustainability 
Scorecard into our enterprise stage-gate process to evaluate new and 
existing products against sustainability KPIs. In 2022, we implemented 
the scorecard across all early-stage R&D projects.
OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE COSTS AND SUPPORT REDUCTION 
GOALS OF PARTNERS – Cost savings for Alcon and our customers 
could be achieved through energy efficiency initiatives and efforts to 
reduce our use of raw materials in both device manufacturing and 
packaging. Additionally, energy consumption throughout our supply 
chain also has implications for climate change and product costs. In 
2021, we started working with EcoVadis to track our suppliers’ Social 
Impact and Sustainability",Social Impact and Sustainability Report 2022.pdf page no.:51," Risk 
Registers to develop a summary of the top HSE-related risks to the 
organization. On an annual basis, applicable Senior Leadership are 
informed of the overall risk summary by the Global Head of HSE. 
 
On a semi-annual basis, site leadership reviews the current Risk 
Register for updates and confirms that it remains accurate.

Grievance Mechanisms
Grievance mechanisms provide a suitable means of identifying adverse impacts and risks and ensure that 
affected people, groups and representatives can raise their concerns and have access to remedy. ALDI therefore 
recognises the importance of establishing grievance channels that are consistent with the UN Guiding Principles 
and that are made available for anyone possibly negatively affected by our operations along our supply chains. 
We partner with civil society and industry stakeholders to support the creation and implementation of multi-
stakeholder grievance mechanisms in production countries, and are therefore engaging in projects such as 
the amfori SPEAK FOR CHANGE Programme, the Impartial Worker Occupational Safety and Health Complaints 
Mechanism of the RMG Sustainability Council (RSC) or the Complaints System of the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil (RSPO),  and the Issara Worker Voice Programme.
Via these channels, affected rightsholders have the opportunity to submit complaints, including grievances 
related to human rights and environment, which were caused by, contributed to, or directly linked to any action 
of ALDI or ALDI’s direct and indirect business partners.

The health and safety of all employees is a top priority  
at Alstom. Every effort will be made to ensure that the  
highest standards are in place to create a safe workplace for  
all employees. A specific focus is on adopting measures to 
eliminate health and safety risks at all sites and to reduce the 
number of accidents to zero. This is supported by intensive 
training of all employees and managers and adopting a zero-
tolerance policy on deviations from these standards.

Q An employee at our site was recently involved in a work 
accident. It wasn’t very serious, so some of our co-workers 
encouraged him not to report it so that the zero accident 
goals are not negatively impacted. Is this ok?
 No, all work-related accidents must be reported to 
management promptly. First, it is important for the employee 
to receive proper medical attention and second, management 
must be made aware so steps can be taken to ensure that 
all proper safety measures are in place.

Commitment to",ethics_and_sustainable_development_charter_for_alstoms_suppliers_and_contractors_.pdf page no.:1
Amazon,", Suppliers must provide on-site 
health facilities with qualified health professionals for 
any health-related emergencies. 
3. Physically Demanding Work
Suppliers are required to continually identify, evaluate, 
and control physically demanding tasks (including 
manual material handling and heavy or repetitive 
lifting, prolonged standing, and highly repetitive or 
forceful work) to help ensure that worker health and 
safety is not jeopardized. If workplace conditions 
could result in harm from heat or cold stress, workers 
must be provided with adequate heat, ventilation, 
PPE, rest options, sun protection (e.g., shade), and/
or hydration. We encourage Suppliers to establish 
practices that enable workers to take adequate rest 
and water breaks during their shifts, taking into 
account the environment and the physical demands 
of the tasks.  
4. Emergency Preparedness and Response
Suppliers are required to identify and plan for 
emergency situations by implementing response 
systems and emergency plans and training their 
workers on them at least annually. We require 
response systems and emergency plans to include 
emergency reporting; alarm systems; worker notifi -
cation and evacuation procedures; worker training 
and drills; first-aid supplies; fire detection and sup -
pression equipment; unblocked, unobstructed, and 
unlocked exit facilities; contact information for",amazon_supply_chain_standards_english.pdf page no.:7," and control procedures 
are foundational to ensuring consistent risk 
prevention and continuous improvement. This 
section provides examples of policies and controls. It 
is not an exhaustive list.
Policies and Controls Examples
• Document Retention: A policy which prohibits 
all forms of retention of workers’ personal docu -
ments, in line with international standards, local 
laws and regulations, whichever is stricter. This 
policy should apply to all workers, and should in -
clude a commitment to carry out due diligence 
of relevant business partners to monitor compli -
ance with the policy.
• Ethical Behavior: A set of policies that foster 
and enforce ethical behavior, including a gift and 
hospitality policy for determining whether or not 
a gift is appropriate, a whistleblower policy (in -
cluding a policy against retaliation), and human 
resource policies that drive ethical behavior, such 
as screening management applicants with back -
ground checks.
• Wages and Benefits: A policy in line with local 
labor laws that applies to all workers (direct, dis -
patch, migrant, contract, temporary, piece-rate, 
and other categories, as appropriate). Where 
such laws do not exist, Suppliers are encouraged 
to maintain policies that provide workers benefits, 
such as paid leave.
• Health and Safety: Controls to prevent injurious 
or fatal hazards include, but are not limited to, as-
signing specific individuals with defined responsi-
bilities for ensuring facilities have adequate fire 
prevention and extinguishing equipment in place, 
and that it is regularly inspected, tested, and 
maintained. Suppliers should provide workers 
with training to prevent, mitigate, and respond 
to health and safety risks, including conducting 
emergency response drills.
• Working Hours: Suppliers should control work -
ing hours by assigning individuals with defined 
responsibility and accountability for comprehen -
sive production and/or staffing planning, and 
ensuring that contributing factors are controlled. 
For example, establishing a mechanism for over -
time approval that requires senior management 
sign-off for hours in excess of company limits.
• Fair Treatment: A policy that commits the Sup -
plier to promoting fair treatment and",amazon-supplier-manual-english.pdf page no.:5," hours 
are correctly calculated.  Suppliers should regularly 
review worker salaries to evaluate whether workers 
earn enough to meet their basic needs and the needs 
of their family and adjust accordingly at least every 
two years. 
Pay Methods: Suppliers are required to provide their 
workers with timely pay stubs or similar documen -
tation that includes an explanation for the basis of 
their compensation  in a manner that workers can 
understand. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary 
measure are not permitted. Suppliers are encouraged 
to transition from cash payments to digital wage 
payment systems. 
Benefits and leave policies: Suppliers must provide 
benefits and leave to all workers in accordance with 
legal requirements. Suppliers should have a parental 
leave policy that reflects those requirements and 
clearly outlines any additional protections and 
benefits provided during parental leave and during 
pregnancy/before parental leave. Even where the law 
is silent, we encourage Suppliers to provide workers 
with paid leave, including for rest and leisure time, 
vacation, public holidays, and parental leave. We 
encourage Suppliers to offer parents or caretakers of 
young children on-site childcare facilities or subsidies 
and adequate, flexible working arrangements.
6. Working Hours
Suppliers should regularly monitor working hours to 
maintain the safety, health, and welfare of workers. 
Except in special or emergency situations, (i) suppliers 
are required to limit working hours to no more than",amazon_supply_chain_standards_english.pdf page no.:5
AMC Networks," and financial 
documents provided to the Supplier by the Company must be accurate and truthful.  
IV. REPORTS OF VIOLATIONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION

expected to raise concerns related to potential violations of this Policy.  Reports can be made to

providing appropriate training to all workers on their rights within the Code of Conduct and the laws of the
